# DataVisualization
Dashboard for an Automotive Company

I completed the IBM Data Visualization with Pyhton course and this is the final project that I did for the course.

The project was done in python and utilzed the pandas, dash, and ploty express python libraries.
The data is pulled from a make belive automotive comapny then filterd and processed and sorted to be turned into 
an assorment of graphs. The graphs are utilzed in an interactive dahsbpard format to mimic how a data scientist might present a project to
a group of shareholder in a conference or meeting. Some of the graphs are meant to focus on what might be an underlying cause for varations in 
automobile sales.
