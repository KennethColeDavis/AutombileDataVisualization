# Automobile Sales Data and Dashboard
Dashboard for an Automotive Company

I completed the IBM Data Visualization with Pyhton course and this is the final project that I did for the course.

This project, built using Python, leverages the pandas, Dash, and Plotly Express libraries to analyze and visualize data from a hypothetical automotive company. The data is processed, filtered, and sorted to generate a variety of interactive graphs, which are presented within a dynamic dashboard. The dashboard is designed to replicate how a data scientist might share insights with stakeholders during a meeting or conference, emphasizing trends and potential underlying causes for variations in automobile sales.

The application allows users to explore sales patterns through graphs such as line charts, bar charts, and pie charts. These visualizations highlight key metrics like advertising expenditures, vehicle type performance, and the impact of macroeconomic factors during specific periods, such as recessions. By transforming raw data into actionable insights, this project demonstrates effective data analysis, visualization, and the ability to communicate findings in an engaging, user-focused format. 

After running the program there should be a pop up in the termina you can copy.

Then paste the URL into a browser and the dashboard will appear where you can view the analyzed data and use the interactive dashboard.
